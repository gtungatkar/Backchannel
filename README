===========Backchannel Application===============
Author: Gaurav Tungatkar

Description:
Backchannel application that allows students in a class to give live feedback on
various topics. It is a forum type format where students can write posts, cheer
others' posts and reply to other posts. Admin users can delete users, grant or
revoke admin privileges to other users and get a report on the posts with
maximum cheers, etc.

Rationale: 
The rationale behind this was to encourage students to post links or additional
tidbits of info about topics discussed in class. Others should respond to these
posts and cheer if they like them. Students can get credit for valuable links
that expand on certain topics in class and are popular amongst other students.

Limitations:
First ever project using Ruby on Rails. Front-end is shabby, tried to get the
server side functionality working! :)
